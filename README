**********************************
Here is a step by step guideline on install Rabindra, the phonetic
input method for Bengali and Sanskrit.

-Open a terminal, go to the directory where you have downloaded all
the files of Rabindra. Henceforth, we are assuming that you are using
Bash on Ubuntu (any other shell on any other free operating system
will be similar).

-Install ibus-m17n.
sudo apt-get install ibus-m17n
 
-Keep the mim files in the correct location.
sudo cp bn-rabindra.mim /usr/share/m17n/
sudo cp sa-sanskrit.mim /usr/share/m17n/

-Keep the icon file in the correct location.
sudo cp bn-rabindra.png /usr/share/m17n/icons/
sudo cp bn-rabindra.png /usr/share/m17n/icons/sa-sanskrit.png

-Ditto for the font.
mkdir -p ~/.fonts
cp Rabindra.ttf ~/.fonts/

-Start ibus-daemon; add Bengali-rabindra and Sanskrit-sanskrit as
input methods. You might want to configure shortcuts, and add the
command ibus-daemon to the startup applications list.

**********************************
Here is a brief introduction to the phonetic input method for
Bengali. The phonetic input method for Sanskrit is similar.

-Start the phonetic input method through ibus-daemon. You may use this
for any text entry field (e.g. browser, text editor).

-If the letters do not display properly, you may choose the font
Rabindra. It contains Lohit Bengali fonts and modified Lohit Hindi
fonts (the few letters where the Sanskrit script differs from the
Hindi script are modified).

-Start typing. The keymapping is fairly natural (with some additional
shortcuts). The following are some of the features.

--অ is represented by a, not o. Therefore, আ is represented by aa or
A, and ও is represented by o.
--For the longer sounds, type twice, i.e., aa for আ, ii for ঈ, uu for
ঊ, and so on.
--ঋ is represented by wri.
--For the harder/longer sounds, type in capitals, e.g. T for ট, Th for
ঠ, D for ড, N for ণ, R for ড়, J for য.
--ঙ is Ng, ঞ is Nj.
--শ, স¸ and ষ are sh, s and S, respectively.
--For hasanta, use `.
--For juktakkhors, type the consecutive consonants. For example, ndr
for ন্দ্র, kt for ক্ত, shr for শ্র.  Therefore, ব-ফলা is w, র-ফলা is r,
য-ফলা is y.
--Some juktakkhors have shortcuts, like gy for জ্ঞ (for গ্য use gY), nj
for ঞ্জ, x for ক্ষ (the usual method to enter ক্ষ would have kS). I will
leave the rest to you to discover for yourself.
--ঃ is represented by H; for ঁ, use ^.
--It is often useful to disrupt the phonetic transliteration; use
$. For example, to type করতে, type kar$te; if you type karte, you get
কর্তে; you may also type karate to get করতে, although that is a bit
unnatural.  (Additional note: Since I use LaTeX a lot, which uses the
symbol $ a lot, I have reconfigured my Caps Lock to mean $. Therefore,
typing $ is really easy for me. (Use xmodmap to reconfigure Caps
Lock.))
